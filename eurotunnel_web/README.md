#How to run
This branch will only run in conjunction with https://github.com/Dr-Jiaqi/EuroTunnel/tree/dev/use_shared_db

Copy this branch is a sub-module and lives in <root>/eurotunnel_web/eurotunnel_web

Once you have the out project setup you should be able to run this with the following commands:

`make full-frontend`

`make docker-compose`

This will bring the full system up and expose this service on port 1234
