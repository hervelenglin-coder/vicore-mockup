<!-- alert for when something hasn't worked
I need an error_text attribute in the Vue object to work
Also, I strongly suspect this isn't how you're supposed to use Vue 
-->
<div v-if="error_text" class="alert alert-danger alert-dismissible fade show alert-fixed" 
role="alert"
>
[[ error_text  ]] 
<buton type="button" class="btn-close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close" v-on:click="error_text=null"></button>          
</div>
