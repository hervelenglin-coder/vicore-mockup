How to run the Frontend locally from the VSCode terminal.

Prerequisites:
- A valid database running in Docker (e.g. Docker Desktop) on port 5432
- A folder of wheel photos. Current default location is c:/Users/Graeme Yeo/Documents/ET Vision/eurotunnel_web/wheelimg  The default can be changed near the top of app.py, or set the proper environment variable WHEEL_IMG_DIR to your directory.

WSL:
You need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

I installed Debian, but whatever.
Install python3 on it with apt or equivalent.
There are probably other packages, but I can't remember now.

In VSCode:
- Open the terminal (View > Terminal)
- In the top right of the terminal, click the down arrow next to the "+" button and choose "Debian (WSL)" or whatever you installed.
- Start a virtual environment by running "python3 -m venv .venv"
- Then run "source .venv/bin/activate". You should get a (.venv) prefix to your command prompt.
- Now "source .env" which will load the required environment variables. You may need to create .env as it is not in the git repo.
- Now run the appication "python3 app.py"
